# Redux directory

  
  

### In this directory, we manage state and handle action in the application, each action has three cases we should define we should describe the prosses on each of them. About adding a new variable to our Redux store (State) first we need to define the type of new variable in Models/ReduxModel and set an initial value from our reducer. Back to handle action as I mention each action has three cases that should describe the behavior of action. Take a look at an index.ts

  

### Note: we have a .md file in each subdirectory to show an example related to each part
