# Reducer directory


### In this directory we manage store and handle actions in the application, each action has three cases we should define we should describe the prosses on each of them. About adding a new variable to our store (State) first we need to define the type of new variable in Models/ReduxModel and set an initial value from our reducer file. Back to handle action as I mentioned each action has three cases that should describe the behavior of action. Take a look at index.ts.
