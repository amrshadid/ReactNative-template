# Stacks directory


## the are two stacks inside this directory the first stack is called AppStack used for screens that did not need authentication, And the second stack is called AuthStack used for a screen that needs authentication

# Usage

## import screens from the screens directory and define it in the stack take a look at the example in Appstack and Auth Stack, I assume we have two screens one of them needs authentication, and the second screen does not require authentication. And for more information about stacks and how to make a custom style take a look at the React-Navigation documentation to get know-how customization style for the stack.
